# smallbluebutton
Overlay with a small blue button to toggle&amp;check mute status in BigBlueButton conferences

# Basic Example
Make sure the BigBluebutton conference is running in a separate browser window or is the currently focused tab. If then, for example, the containing window has "BigBlueBlutton" in the title, simply start the overlay with

`./smallbluebutton.py "BigBlueButton"`

Afterwards, you can toggle your mute status by clicking the button. For more options, use the flag `-h` or `--help`.
